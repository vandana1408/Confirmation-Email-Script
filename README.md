# Confirmation-Email-Script
Creating a Python Script that will send confirmation emails to a list of people who sign up to UNSW Bioinformatics Society Events. 

This script will take in the following input: 
- Email address to send from
- Password to allow user to enter their email 
- Subject line of email 
- Main message of each email. 
- mailing list (a csv file with minimum first name and email address) 

Things I hope to add onto this project: 
- Include my default signature into the email
- Bcc and Cc inputs 
- regex part to include the '@' for the email 
- assertoric tests
